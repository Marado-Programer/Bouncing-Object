# Bouncing-Object

## What is this?

It's a little project in Java about an object bouncing **REALISTCLY** using the power of Forces and Movements on Physics.

### Lore

I'm a student learning Java and I've finished my school module of "Forces and Movements" on the Physics and Quimics subject.
I was talking with a friend classmate about Java and he's saying like "Man, I didn't understood well the functions, what's public? void? static?".
I tried to explain in my away because I'm not an expert too. How the hell does static works? "I think it's a keyword to a method that don't need an object to be used" I said.
I gave examples using games because we are Zoomers.
"Imagine in Minecraft, your character it's an object, that have atributes like name and other things."
"Your character can jump right? probably that's an non-static void function beacuse needs an object(player) to work and don't return nothing."
And then he start talking about Rocket League and he gave me the idea of simulating a ball bouncing REALISTCLY like in Rocket League.
Here I am:)

I needed to consult the internet for the loop and the KeyListner and the JFrame and Canvas. Maybe one more things. I didn't learn it at school (yet I think). I've learn like the basic things (). I've used Java before the school so I know some things I didn't learn at school but I've heard about
