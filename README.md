# Bouncing-Object

## What is this?

It's a little project in Java about an object bouncing **REALISTCLY** using the power of Forces and Movements on Physics.

### Lore

I'm a student learning Java and I've finished my school module of "Forces and Movements" on the Physics and Quimics subject.

I was talking with a friend classmate about Java and he's saying like _"Man, I didn't understand well the functions, what's public? void? static?"_.

I tried to explain in my way because I'm not an expert too. How the hell does static works? _"I think it's a keyword to a method that doesn't need an object to be used"_ I said.

I gave examples using games because we are Zoomers.

_"Imagine in Minecraft, your character it's an object, that has attributes like name and other things."_

_"Your character can jump, right? probably that's a non-static void function because needs an object(player) to work and don't return anything."_

And then he starts talking about Rocket League and he gave me the idea of simulating a ball bouncing REALISTCLY like in Rocket League.

Here I am:)

I needed to consult the internet for the loop and the KeyListner and the JFrame and Canvas. Maybe one more thing. I didn't learn it at school (yet I think). I've learned the basic things (printing methods, java.swing library, variables and constants, keyboard input, classes Date, Calendar and Locale, arithmetic operators, class Math, ternary and relational operators, conditionals structures, repetition structures, arrays, functions. Maybe more little things). I've used Java before school so I know some things I didn't learn at school but I've heard about.

## How it works?

It's a program that calculates, using the initial velocity, the height, and the velocity of an object at a certain time. You'll need to set a value on `com.marado.entities.BouncingObject ==> double initVelocity;`.

I'm thinking about making able to make you see the object and compare it with an unrealistic object
